## 2.0.0 - 15/02/2023

### Scan Folder (New)

- This feature is an update to the old Scan Folder feature, which sometimes read all file names randomly and saved them in a scrambled order, requiring us to rearrange them. With this feature, the program will create a new folder, copy the files, add numbers to each file name, and the resulting file names will be sequential.

### Add Features
- Added the Scan Folder (New) console menu

### Change Features
- Changed the console menu number for Scan Folder from 1 to 2
- Changed the console menu number for Exit from 2 to 3
